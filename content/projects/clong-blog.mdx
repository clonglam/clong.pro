## What is this?

Game hub is using Vite and chakraui to boostrap, and using a third part api rawg.io.

## Feature

### Infinty scroll

- In this application, I am using `react query` to prefer a `infinty scoll`, we only fetch small amount of data so the application will load faster. Also it provide a bit UX to client.

### Loading Skelton & search Filter

- Loading Skelton is shown while data is fetching. utlized `react query` the code are clean and easy to preform.

### Color Theme

- We can easily provide `light` and `dark` mode with `Charkra-ui`.
