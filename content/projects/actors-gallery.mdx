## What is this?

The AGS Actor Gallery is an innovative platform designed specifically for actors to showcase their talents and professional profiles.

Serving as an actor-centric version of **LinkedIn**, this gallery acts as a comprehensive repository for actors' details,
With the ability to edit profiles and keep information up to date, actors can leverage this platform as a powerful tool for visibility
and career growth in the entertainment industry.

## Difficulty & Solution

### Designing a user-friendly interface

- In this application, I used `@reactHookForm` to handle profile update form, `React Dnd` for handdle Drag n Drop ordering. `@tanstack/react-table` to handle different table.

### Customer Authentication Flow

- In this application, We prepare a custom authentication flow, included login and email authentation, forget password etc..

### Skeletons and loading

- There are many media in this application, Skeletons and loader is important.
