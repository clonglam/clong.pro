The primary goal behind this full-stack project is to create a comprehensive
and versatile platform that is both user-friendly and developer-friendly. By
seamlessly integrating commonly-used third-party applications and tools, like
stripe, react-hookform, reactquery, db with prisma etc.

## Technology used in Frontend

- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) Model Front end JS Framework. we are using React 18
- [React-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) Sate management tools for handdling asynchronous data state (Server State) like products and collections.
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) handle for page routering
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) Light weight and scalable state-management tools and we use it to handle the Client (UI) state like current user, selected theme etc
- [zod](https://zod.dev/) Data validation tool and use it to validate the form data
- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) Easy and light weight Animation Library
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) Third party Payment API, provide secure payment handling.
- [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) simple, modular compent I also created Autocomplete component for the Chakra UI in this project

## Difficulty & Soultion

### How to Query large amount of products data and variables.

I used _React Query_ with `infinite scroll` feature, _React Query_ will also handdle caching,so when even there are large amount of data we can still draft a query and fetch it with different params.
At the past using ReduxRTK and Redux to fetch data in the _infinite scroll_ we do need to do some effort to that, but thanks to _react-query_ we do infinite scroll in clean, maintainable and easy way.

### User Authentication

In production application I would definitely suggest to use some auth provider, like AWS Cognito, Firebase or others. It a hooliday project, I hased the user password and stored in DB, every time user login a JWT token will return to client.

### Documentation

Good Application must include Good Documentation, the backend mainly handle REST API Request, so `swagger` will be a prefect choices in this cases.
