### Global State management

<Dns>
  In the application, I used `@Redux` and `ReduxTK` to handdle the global state.
  Its my first time using it in the react-native environment. Its basically have
  not different to reactJs while using. thats really a great exprenice.

### Map components

<Dns>
  We always use map in mobile application, By using `react-native-maps`, we only
  need to provide `latitude` and `longitude`, map will show in the correct
  place, marker will add to the map.
